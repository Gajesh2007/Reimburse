# Reimburse
Easily track and reimburse all expenses in your DAO on Solana. 

## Description
Reimburse is an expense management system for DAOs (can be also used by companies). The Program tracks and files expenses such as gas cost, deployment rent, and any kind of organisation-related expense.

## How does it work?
1/ User photograph receipts, the photos are uploaded and stored on a distributed storage using IPFS or Arveave.
2/ User fills the details
3/ Approver reviews it.
4/ Once approved, the amount of the reimbursement request gets automatically sent from DAO's wallet to the user who created the request.

Happy Solana Saturday :)
